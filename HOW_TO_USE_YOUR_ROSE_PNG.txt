🌹 HOW TO USE YOUR ROSE PNG IMAGE 🌹

=== YOUR ROSE IMAGE IS NOW ACTIVE! ===

The website now uses YOUR rose PNG image instead of CSS rose!

=== FILE SETUP ===

Make sure your files are arranged like this:

📁 Your Folder
  ├── index.html
  ├── style.css
  ├── script.js
  ├── rose.png  ← Your rose image here!
  └── music.mp3 (optional)

=== IF YOUR IMAGE HAS A DIFFERENT NAME ===

If your rose image is named something else (like "flower.png", "red-rose.png", etc.):

1. Open index.html
2. Find this line (around line 18):
   <img src="rose.png" alt="Rose" class="rose-png" id="rosePng">
3. Change "rose.png" to your filename:
   <img src="flower.png" alt="Rose" class="rose-png" id="rosePng">

=== ANIMATIONS YOUR ROSE HAS ===

✨ Automatic Animations:
- 3D Rotation (spins 360° continuously)
- Floating up and down
- Growing animation when page loads
- Glowing effect around the rose
- Drop shadow for depth

🖱️ Interactive:
- Hover over rose = Pauses rotation, zooms in, brighter glow
- Click on rose = Creates petal explosion!

=== CUSTOMIZING THE ANIMATIONS ===

Want to change animation speed? Edit style.css:

1. Rotation speed (line ~90):
   animation: roseRotate3D 20s infinite linear
   Change "20s" to faster (10s) or slower (30s)

2. Float speed (line ~91):
   roseFloat 4s ease-in-out infinite
   Change "4s" to faster (2s) or slower (6s)

3. Grow animation (line ~92):
   roseGrow 2s ease-out forwards
   Change "2s" to faster (1s) or slower (3s)

=== ROSE IMAGE TIPS ===

✓ Use PNG format with transparent background
✓ Square images work best (500x500px or 1000x1000px)
✓ Keep file size under 2MB for fast loading
✓ High quality images look better
✓ Remove background for best effect

=== TROUBLESHOOTING ===

❌ Rose not showing?
- Check if the filename matches in index.html
- Make sure the image is in the same folder
- Try refreshing the page (F5)
- Check if the image file is corrupted

❌ Animations not working?
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Try a different browser (Chrome works best)
- Check if JavaScript is enabled

❌ Rose looks weird?
- Try a different image
- Make sure it's PNG format
- Check if background is transparent
- Resize image to 500x500px or 1000x1000px

=== ADVANCED CUSTOMIZATION ===

Change rose size (in style.css, line ~85):
.rose-image-container {
    width: 400px;  ← Change this
    height: 400px; ← And this
}

Change glow color (in style.css, line ~115):
background: radial-gradient(circle, 
    rgba(255, 23, 68, 0.4) 0%,  ← Change these RGB values
    rgba(196, 30, 58, 0.3) 30%,
    ...
