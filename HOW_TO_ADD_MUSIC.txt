🎵 HOW TO ADD BACKGROUND MUSIC 🎵

=== STEP 1: Get Your Music File ===

1. Choose a romantic song (MP3 format works best)
2. Some suggestions:
   - "Perfect" by Ed Sheeran
   - "All of Me" by John Legend
   - "Thinking Out Loud" by Ed Sheeran
   - "A Thousand Years" by Christina Perri
   - Any romantic instrumental music

=== STEP 2: Add the Music File ===

1. Place your music file in the SAME FOLDER as index.html
2. Rename it to: music.mp3
   (Or keep the original name and update the HTML)

=== STEP 3: If You Use a Different Filename ===

If your music file is named something else (like "love-song.mp3"):

1. Open index.html
2. Find this line (around line 11):
   <source src="music.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
3. Change "music.mp3" to your filename:
   <source src="love-song.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">

=== STEP 4: Test It ===

1. Open index.html in your browser
2. Click the music button (🔇) in the top-right corner
3. It should change to 🔊 and start playing!

=== MUSIC CONTROLS ===

- 🔊 Button in top-right corner = Music is playing
- 🔇 Button in top-right corner = Music is paused
- Click the button to toggle play/pause
- Music loops automatically!

=== TROUBLESHOOTING ===

❌ Music not playing?
- Make sure the file is named "music.mp3"
- Make sure it's in the same folder as index.html
- Try clicking the music button
- Check if the file is actually MP3 format

❌ Button not working?
- Refresh the page (F5)
- Try a different browser (Chrome works best)
- Check browser console for errors (F12)

=== FILE STRUCTURE ===

Your folder should look like this:

📁 Your Folder
  ├── index.html
  ├── style.css
  ├── script.js
  ├── music.mp3  ← Your music file here!
  └── README.md

=== TIPS ===

✓ Use MP3 format for best compatibility
✓ Keep file size under 10MB for faster loading
✓ Choose a song that's 3-5 minutes long
✓ Make sure you have rights to use the song
✓ Test on mobile too - some phones block auto-play

=== ADVANCED: Multiple Songs ===

Want to add multiple songs? Edit index.html:

<audio id="bgMusic" loop>
    <source src="song1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    <source src="song2.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    <source src="song3.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
</audio>

The browser will play the first supported format.
